# Vision for this project until summer 2021

Until summer 2021 we want to implement a **first working web-app** for our use case.
This incldues:
- **user management**
    - confortable user log-in
    - only single user accounts, no organisations 
- **different front-ends** to create bot flows
    - BPMN-editor (`bpmn.js`)
    - code-editor (edit `.robot`-code)
    - (if possible one more frontend-editor)
- many applications are supported with **RPA tasks**, only a few tasks work via an **API**
- created bots are **running locally**; for this purpose we provide an Ark Automate **local client**
- users can **interact** with the bots by...
    - ... starting the bots via our control interface of the web app
    - ... viewing basic statistics in the control interface of the web app
    - ... by using an API (especially for external companies)
