## Our current Scrum process is the following:

### General 
- One sprint is usually three weeks long.
- The teams core work time is monday (9am-3pm) and wednesday (9am-3pm)
- Each member of the team works about 16 hours per week

Update: Starting March 8, the team will work on the project four days a week. Monday-Wednesday will be the core work days that each team member will work. The fourth workday can be any of the days from Thursday through Sunday. 

### Meetings

**1. Daily Scrum:**
Limited to 15 min the daily scrum takes place monday morning at 9am and wednesday morning at 9am in MS Teams.
Only the core team is participating including Maximilian.
The structure the team agreed on is that every team member shortly answers the following three questions:
* What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team achieve the sprint goal?
* What will I do today to help the Development Team achieve the sprint goal?
* Do I see any obstacle that will prevent me or the Development Team from achieving the Sprint Goal?

**2. Sprint Planning:**
It usually takes place at the first day of the new sprint. It should never exceed 4 hours.
Only the core team is participating including Maximilian. The Scrum Master is inviting everyone. The goal is to define a sprint backlog and a sprint goal as well as the responsibilities for the different issues. We estimate the effort of the stories using Planning Poker. We decided to use the Fibonacci scale at the beginning of the 6th sprint. One story point corresponds to 2 man-hours.

**3. Sprint Review:**
It usually takes place at the last day of the sprint. It takes about 1 hour. 
The core team is participating as well as important Stakeholders like Prof. Weske, Tobias Metzke-Bernstein, Simon Siegert, Maximilian VÃ¶lker. Invitation is done by the Product Owner.
First, the Product Owner presents which stories of the backlog were done and the Development Team shows the product increment and explains what went well and what challenges they faced. Second, the stakeholders give feedback on the product increment and give valuable input for the next sprint.

**4. Sprint Retrospective:**
It takes place directly 0.5 hours after the sprint review. It should not exceed 1.5 hours. Only the core team is participating.
The Scrum Master is inviting everyone. The goal is to reflect on the last sprint and find ways to improve the scrum process as well as the way the team works together. The Scrum Master informs Maximilian about any changes to the process and updates this wiki.
