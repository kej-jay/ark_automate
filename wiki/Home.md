## How to contribute to the wiki

To contribute a page to the wiki, please create a markdown file in the `wiki` directory. It will automatically be deployed as a wiki page once it it pushed onto the DEV branch.  
The page title will have the same name as the filename of your created file and will show hyphens as emptyspaces. Therefore we ask you to not use emptyspaces in your filenames.

> The deployment of wiki pages will overwrite the existing pages, so if you want to persist your article in the wiki, please go the route of creating a markdown file.
