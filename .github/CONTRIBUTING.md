# How to contribute

## reporting bugs
* Use the [bug template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
* Be descriptive when creating an issue (what, where, when and how does a problem pop up)?
* Attach steps to reproduce (if applicable)
* Attach code samples, configuration options or stack traces that may indicate a problem
* Be helpful and respect others when commenting

## feature requests
* Use the [user-story template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-story.md) or just put your thoughts on a note
* Please formulate your thoughts and wishes behind the user story
* If available, define open questions that we should discuss before starting the work
* Define your acceptance criteria that fulfil your feature request

## pull requests
Some things that make it easier for us to accept your pull requests. We also provide a [pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

* The code is tested
* The code is well documented
* The linter has nothing to note
* The `npm start` build passes
* The pull request matches our requests from the template (screenshots, problem description, description of the solution)

We'd be glad to assist you if you do not get these things right in the first place.
